# GenAI Application for Network Topology Image Analysis

This application leverages Streamlit and OpenAI's GPT-4V model to analyze networking topology images. It provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to upload images of network topologies and receive insights and analyses generated by the GPT-4V model.

## Features

- Upload interface for network topology images.
- Real-time analysis of images using OpenAI's GPT-4V.
- Interactive chat interface to discuss and query network topology features.
- Session state management to maintain interaction history.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Poetry for dependency management
- An OpenAI API key

## Installation

### Setting Up the Environment

1. **Clone the repository:**
